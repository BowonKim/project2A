                <p>Hi, I'm Bowon Kim, a senior and will graduate this summer at Minnesota State University, Mankato.
                    I am majoring in Computer Information Technology and minoring in Graphic Design. I am planning to go
                    back to Korea with my cat, Winnie after graduation.</p>

                <p>
                    I grew up in South Korea and I came to the United States to study English and experience other
                    worlds. Since I was young, I liked to do something with the computer so I decided to major in
                    computer information technology however during the three years of college, I could not find any
                    fields that want to study more deeply and work in the specific field. I focused on studying and
                    getting good grades without participating in any activities because I didn't know what I want to do.
                    Then, while taking the graphic design and web design courses last semester, I came across web
                    development for the first time. While developing the website for the project, it was really
                    interesting that I could see the results visually right away. I thought it was a perfect field that
                    combines design and coding that I love and I could find what I want to do after graduation. After
                    deciding what I want to do, I'm studying to improve my skills these days.</p>
